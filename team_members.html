			 <p class="card-text">Powered by triple 300hp Yamaha's and a 3-owner boat we knew we were going to have some cosmetic 
					work to be done, but only 100hrs on the new motors along with new fuel tanks.</p>
					<p> In 2015, we contacted Live Wire Electronics in Myrtle Beach, SC about getting the boat re-wired. 
					We decided to get a new sound system via J.L. Audio, new gps and sonar from Garmin Marine. Along with 
					new VHF radio's from iCom America and a Fusion Entertainment receiver.</p>
					<p> In the spring of 2017, we took the Yellowfin to Wrap's Ink in Murrells Inlet, SC. We had them design
					the new wrap, and remove the previous owner's PAST DUE logos.</p>

			working at OVM Finicial and taking care of his little boy. He can be found in his bay boat chasing drum, trout or flounder.
			During college, he played baseball with Josh Hughes they had stayed in touch over the years and talked about
			fishing. After doing some near-shore fishing with his dad and family members, he wanted to do more offshore fishing.
			After much discussion with Josh Hughes, he joined the team in 2013. Since joing the team, his enthusiasm and humor, keeps the team laughing
			wether on days where the bite is a fast or slow bite. There's always a "Rember this" moment.  If you get a chance, ask him about his "Cobia stories" from
