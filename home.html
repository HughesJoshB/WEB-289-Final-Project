		<h3>About Us</h3>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<p> Born and raised in Ocean Isle Beach, we've always been drawn to the ocean, and all of it's
					activities.	Both the Captain and Co-Captain grew up surfing the local breaks on Ocean Isle. We
					fished local in-shore ponds, the waterway,and piers on days where the surf wasnâ€™t churning out
					ridable waves. In the 1970's, Captain William "Frollie" Hughes moved to Wrightsville Beach to attend
					colege at UNCW. He frequented the piers, and statred fising for kings after seeing the anchor rod and
					clip method of fishing. Between classes, surfing and playing baseketbal, this was the place he preferred 
					to fish.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<p> After fishing for 6 years, in the 23' and under class, with Teak Hemphill on the Playing Hooky,
					a boat was purchased, and Dad an son began fishing some tournaments and fishing offshore. Using a 19'Pioneer
					with a 150 hp Yamaha was a challenge, but we entered some of the smaller local events. During the Octboer beach
					bite, we were fun fishing the Long Bay area of Southeastern, NC. The U.S. Open King Mackerel tournament, which normally
					pulls close to 400 boats, was going on but we had never entered it. While in the midst of these boats, we caught and
					released a 40+ pound fish, and were "hooked". Instantly, we both agreed we would fish some of the bigger events
					the next year. In the U.S. Open the next year we caught a 27.10 lb king that tied us for 55th place.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">		
					<p>We fished the Pioneer for several years. In 2010, we decided to fish the SKA Division 9 Tournament Trail and
					began scouring ads and post for a bigger boat to fish the open class. Our 29ft Yellowfin did us well for 3 years.
					We fished all of Division 9 Tournaments, and some of the SC Division tournaments. After rigging out the boat, we entered
					the East Coast Got Em On, and placed 14th. We continued to catch fish adn win a few smaller prizes. Just before the 2014 
					season began we sold the 29' Yellowfin. Captain "Frollie" dedicated himself to finding a new boat before the first tournament
					of the year, and one week before he found our current boat, a 34' Yellowfin, powered by tripe 300hp Yamaha's. We've
					been blessed to fish from Morehead City, NC to Charleston, SC in local tournaments and the SKA Division 9 and 3 trails.
					In 2012, we fished the SKA National Championship in Biloxi, MS, and the 2016 in Morehead City, NC.</p>
